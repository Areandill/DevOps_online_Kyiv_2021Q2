First course task. <br>
For Task1.1 I created new private repo on GitHub portal. Then created ssh keys to avoid writing login and password, using "ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 8081" command. Then I cloned repo to local machine and created first file, called it "readme.txt" and made first commit. Then I created new branch "<i>develop</i>" switch to it and add empty file <b>"index.html"</b>. After this I created two more branches "<i>images</i>" and "<i>styles</i>" and folders  "images" and "styles". In folder "images" I put few images and changed index.html <br>

<br>
Then I went back to develop branch, after this I merged branch "<i>images</i>" with "<i>develop</i>" and branch <i>"styles"</i> with  "<i>develop</i>". During merge I got merge conflict and resolve it. After successful merge I change branch back to "<i>main</i>" and merge it with "<i>develop</i>". In the end I done git push --all to github portal.
