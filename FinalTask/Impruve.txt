1. Затримка запуску між контейнерами
2. Amazon autoscailing group
3. Amazon dynamic inventory



At first I wroute docker-compose.yml file and two Dockerfiles. 
Using this files and installed docker I can easy run two containers with Jenkins
Master in first and with Jenkins Slave in second.
Jenkins Master hold build on docker vault and transfer build with files from GitHUB to Jenkins Slave.
Jenkins Slave runs Terraform that creates EC2 instance.
After creation EC2, public IP address of the instance copied to ansible hosts file.
In the end
