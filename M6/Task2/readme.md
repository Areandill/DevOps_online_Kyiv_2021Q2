## Task6.2 <br>
1 <em>Use already created internal-network for three VMs (VM1-VM3). VM1 has NAT and internal, 
VM2, VM3 â€“ internal only interfaces.Install and configure DHCP server on VM1. 
(3 ways: using VBoxManage, DNSMASQ and ISC-DHSPSERVER).
 </em> <br>
On MV1 i configured netplan for local network and set local ip address. Then Installed dnsmasq and configured DHCP and DNS servers. On VM2 and VM3 I in "netplan" set dhcp auto configuration to true. Then on VM1 I used commands "sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o enp0s3 -j MASQUERADE" for routing internal network to internet. 
2 <em>  Check VM2 and VM3 for obtaining network addresses from DHCP server.</em><br>
